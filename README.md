# Zebrafish-behaviour-analysis
This study investigates how the M-current, a potassium ion current, shapes spinal neuron excitability and swimming behaviors in zebrafish larvae, using automated tracking (Zebrabox). Analysis scripts are shared on GitHub to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility, facilitating further studies on spinal motor circuits.
